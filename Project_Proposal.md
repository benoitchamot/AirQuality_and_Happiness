# Project Proposal – Group 1
The objective of our project is to uncover patterns in air quality and quality of life. We will examine the relationships between a country's air quality and the Country Happiness Index, as well as any correlation between air quality and life expectancy. Additionally, we will investigate the impact of air quality on asthma hospitalisations in specific regions by analysing relevant AU data.

## Air Quality vs Happiness Index
- Which countries have the best/worst air quality – Graph 1
- Air quality data (top 5 countries) vs country happiness index – Graph 2
- Air quality data (worst 5 countries) vs country happiness index – Graph 3

## Air Quality vs Life Expectancy Index
- Air quality vs life expectancy for the top 5 air quality countries – Graph 4
- Air quality vs life expectancy for the worst 5 air quality countries – Graph 5

## Air Quality vs Asthma Hospitalisations
- Australian Air Quality data for 2020-2021 for certain regions – Graph 6
- Air Quality vs Asthma Hospitalisations (2020-2021) – Graph 7
