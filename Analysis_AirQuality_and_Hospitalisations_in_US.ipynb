    "# Analysis of Air Quality and Hospitalisations in the US\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we compare the air quality data and the number of hospitalisation per US state per year. The geographical area was selected based on the availability of data for both air quality and hospitalisation: we could not easily find similar data for other countries or regions. This is a follow-up to the analysis on air quality and asthma prevalence. In that previous analysis, we found a counterintuitive negative correlation between air quality and asthma prevalence. We wanted to take the analysis a step further by not looking at the number of people having asthma but rather at the possible impact of poorer air quality on severe asthma symptoms that require hospitalisation. In this part of the study, we expect to see a positive correlation between poor air quality and hospitalisation. In other words: the higher the concentration of PM2.5, the more people with asthma will have to be hospitalised."

Although the data available do not allow to draw any conclusion for causality, there is a correlation between the concentration of PM2.5 in the air and the number of hospital admissions due to asthma. The higher concentration of PM2.5 is expected to cause asthmatic reactions and the data confirm that this could be the case."
